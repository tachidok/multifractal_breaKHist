# Multifractal spectrum based classification for breast cancer

The dataset (.csv file) results from computing fractal dimensions for BreaKHis dataset
The jupyter notebook takes the fractal dimensions, generates the multifractal spectrum at the patient level and performs a classification using:
* Naive-Bayes
* KNN
* Multilayer perceptron
* Decision tree
* Random forest

with outstanding results for the last two.
